# Yogesh :i-line-md-coffee-loop

Hey, I am Yogesh, a self-taught developer.
 
I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies. I love open source and writing about tech occasionally. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects). 

Currently I am focusing on web technologies.

I love to chase ideas and I spend a lot of time using some great product applications, learning from their successes and using them to inspire my creativity.
